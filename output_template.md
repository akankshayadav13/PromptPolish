## 💬 **2. Rewritten Text**
The improved version of the user's input.  
Must follow these rules:

- preserve the *original meaning*  
- improve clarity and flow  
- remove grammar issues  
- match selected tone and personality  
- avoid robotic or overly complex words  
- sound human, warm, and confident  

---

## 📎 **3. Optional Notes (Only When Needed)**
If the system makes an improvement decision (e.g., removing repetition),
an optional one-line note can be added:

- “Condensed redundant phrases for better clarity.”  
- “Added confidence without changing intent.”  

These notes should appear **only when helpful**.
